# Companion to Crank From Scratch

The blog post [Writing Crank from Scratch](https://crank.js.org/blog/writing-crank-from-scratch) does a great job of walking the reader though the changes and considerations made when creating the Crank library. The corresponding [crank-from-scratch repository](https://github.com/brainkim/crank-from-scratch) contains the code changes and diffs for each step outlined in the blog post.

This compainion repository was created to make the code at each step more accessible. It contains 16 pages where each page corresponds to a step in the above blog post. With the changes broken out like this it's easier to expiriment with the evolution of the `crank.js` file at any point.
